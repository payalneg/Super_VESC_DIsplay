GPIO 48  →   CTX (TX)          
GPIO 47  ←   CRX (RX)          
3.3V     →   VCC              
GND      →   GND      →        GND
                    CAN_H  →   CAN_H
                    CAN_L  →   CAN_L
```

#### VESC Configuration:

## ⚙️ Settings and Configuration

### Settings Screen

Available settings via touchscreen:

#### Battery Configuration
- **Battery Capacity (Ah)**: Battery capacity (1.0 - 200.0 Ah)
- **Battery Calculation Mode**:
  - **Direct from Controller**: Percentage based on voltage
  - **Smart Calculation**: Calculation based on Ah consumption

#### VESC Motor Limits
- **Motor Current Max**: Maximum motor current (5.0 - 200.0 A)
- **Battery Current Max**: Maximum battery current (5.0 - 200.0 A)
- **ERPM Max**: Maximum speed (10k - 200k ERPM)
- "Read Limits from VESC" and "Apply Limits to VESC" buttons

#### Display Settings
- **Screen Brightness**: Screen brightness (0-100%)

### Smart Battery Calculation

**Smart Calculation Mode** provides more accurate battery charge calculation:

**How it works:**
1. Tracks actual Ah consumption instead of voltage
2. Automatically detects charging (>10% increase)
3. Saves state every 30 seconds to NVS
4. Accounts for regenerative braking
5. Restores state after reboot

**When to use:**
- ✅ For more accurate charge display
- ✅ With variable power consumption
- ✅ For better range estimation
- ✅ With regenerative braking

**Calibration:**
- Automatic when charging is detected
- Manual reset by changing battery capacity
- State persists across reboots

### Trip Statistics Persistence

**Trip Persistence:**
- Automatic saving of trip distance and Ah every 10 seconds
- Value restoration on device power-on
- Automatic detection of VESC reset (power cycle)
- Manual reset function for battery replacement

**Usage:**
```cpp
// Get trip distance
float trip_km = vesc_rt_data_get_trip_km();

// Get consumed Ah
float amp_hours = vesc_rt_data_get_amp_hours();

// Reset on battery replacement
battery_calc_reset_trip_and_ah();
```

### Range Calculation

**Algorithm:**
- Uses Ah/km instead of Wh/km for better accuracy
- Recalculates every 100 meters or 0.1 Ah
- Caches result for stable readings
- Integrated with smart battery calculation

**Formula:**
```
Range = remaining_ah / (consumed_ah / distance_km)
```

- Ensure device name is "SuperVESCDisplay"
- Reboot device

**No response from VESC via BLE**
- Check CAN connection to VESC
- Ensure VESC is configured to send status
- Check logs in Serial Monitor

### Battery Issues

**Battery percentage seems incorrect**

- Try switching to Direct mode
- Reboot device for calibration

**Percentage increases during use**
- This is normal during regenerative braking
- Check regenerative braking settings in VESC

### Display Issues

speed_kmh = (RPM * wheel_diameter_m * π * 60) / 1000
```

**Current → Power:**
```
power_watts = voltage_v * current_a
```
